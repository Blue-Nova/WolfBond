 - Multi Dimentional Dog working
 - balance the progression (make it faster 1-2 entities will do one upgrade, make the size scale faster, jump power lessen, follow range adapt, knockback resist adapt)
 - DOG SHOULD BE ABLE TO HIT THE DRAGON
 - At some point, maybe fire resistance? OR allow the dog to be smaller but also lessen the stats
 - better dog control (auto aggro, guard mode)
